## Course Content

### ОПАМ (Fundamentals of Algorithmic Programming)

Focuses on programming fundamentals using C++:

#### First Semester:
- **Lab 3**: Conditional statements and branching logic
- **Lab 4**: More complex conditional expressions with mathematical functions
- **МКР2**: Control works including table generation and vote counting simulations

#### Second Semester:
- Sorting algorithms (bubble sort)
- Custom functions for data manipulation

### ОС (Operating Systems)

Covers operating system concepts through practical implementations:

- **Lab 3**: File and directory management
  - Directory creation and organization
  - File copying between directories
  - File renaming and modification
  
- **Lab 4**: Process management and networking
  - Listing running processes
  - Pinging websites
  - Monitoring system processes
  
- **Lab 5**: System security
  - Checking antivirus status
  - Verifying BitLocker encryption
  - Monitoring firewall configuration
  - Checking Windows update settings
  - Scanning for file access permissions

## Programming Languages

The repository includes code in:
- C++ (primarily for ОПАМ labs)
- Python (primarily for ОС labs)
- C# (for some ОС implementations)

## Getting Started

Most programs can be run in their respective environments:
- C++ files can be compiled with any C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Python files can be executed with a Python interpreter
- C# files can be compiled with .NET compiler
